# Horiseon
## Description
This website needed some code clean up in both HTML files and CSS.  It also needed better seperators and titles to make it more accessible to help assistive technologies across the board.  
The images now have "alt" attributes, the CSS file has been cleaned up for an easier to read outline without so many repeating lines of code.  The HTML as also been given headers, footers, and sections to help with any future edits that may need to happen.
The following link shows the website also still has the same outline for any potential viewers, https://will2tall.github.io/Horiseon/
